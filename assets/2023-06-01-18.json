The National Election Commission (NEC) refused the Auditor's audit due to concerns of a violation of independence. The NEC official clarified that the inspection cannot be received as it may affect the independence and neutrality of the NEC. However, the Auditor argued that there is no problem with the audit progress and that only officials belonging to the National Assembly, Court, and Constitutional Court are within the legal basis for the audit. The results of the audit are expected to be presented this month. The Auditor also refused to audit a child's preferential recruitment."

        "content": "The Central Election Commission in South Korea has refused to undergo an audit by the National Audit Office regarding suspicion of preferential hiring of high-ranking children. The commission has stated that it is not subject to job inspections. However, it is possible for them to be investigated by the National Assembly and investigative agencies. An official from the National Audit Office has expressed concern that it's hard to imagine the commission would not have the data regarding the alleged preferential hiring.In addition, it's not the first time the commission has faced refusal to have their job inspected, as they also declined during the “Sokuri voting” controversy in the presidential election last year."

        "content": "The Central Election Commission (NEC) in South Korea is facing calls to resign after allegations of unfair practices and nepotism in the organisation were exposed. The NEC is meant to be impartial and fair in their work, but it has been revealed that employees have been giving preference to their family members and political allies. The People Power Party has called for a national investigation into the matter due to its concerning nature. The issues at the NEC could pose a risk to national security if not dealt with efficiently and fairly. The Chief Commissioner of the NEC has said that change is possible."

The investigation is set to be conducted solely by the National Civil Rights Commission and is expected to be completed by the end of the month. The investigation will include current and former civil servants related to the relevant committee. The investigation will not infringe on the independence of the NEC and will be conducted through the Act on the Installation and Operation of the Corruption and the National Rights Commission. The investigation could be extended due to the lack of cooperation from the NEC."

        "content": "The National Civil Rights Commission in South Korea has launched a full investigation into the suspicion of \"preferential recruitment\" of senior children of the Election Management Committee. The Vice-Chairman of the Commission, Seung-Yoon Chung, held a briefing on June 1st in which he announced that a dedicated recruitment corruption investigation team would be formed to conduct a full-scale investigation on suspicion of hiring corruption. The investigation will last for one month in June, but could be extended if needed, and will include investigating all retirees of the Committee. This move follows the Committee's announcement of its own audit results, which led to four people, including the Secretary-General, being asked about the allegations. The National Civil Rights Commission emphasizes that their investigation should be respected in the realm of fair management of people's rights, freedom protection, and elections."

        "content": "A South Korean court has sentenced singer and actor Ir (real name Cho Sung-hyun) to one year in prison for swapping drivers while drunk last September. Ir was caught driving while intoxicated and asked his manager, surnamed Park, to switch places with him. Park is now accused of helping Ir in his criminal activity. The court noted that even though Ir was a first-time offender, he showed repeated behavior and thus deserved the imprisonment sentence. The judge also mentioned that Ir drove his Mercedes-Benz car at the speed of 184.5 km/h (115 mph) while drunk."

He was accused of driving under the influence of alcohol with a female professional golfer in Seoul last September. The police initially thought the golfer was driving but later found that Ir was the one driving through CCTV footage. Ir's blood alcohol concentration was 0.075%, which was at the level of suspension. His lawyer requested a lenient sentence, taking into account his cooperation with the police investigation, lack of human and physical damage, and confession of the crime."

In September of last year, Ir was caught driving drunk after drinking in a restaurant in Seoul's Hannam-dong area. Although her blood-alcohol level was not high enough to warrant punishment, she was accused of having her passenger, professional golfer A, take the wheel during the police investigation. A was later charged with helping Ir hide her actions. Ir is also accused of giving her car to colleague B, who drove drunk, and driving Mr. C's car while drunk and speeding. Her blood-alcohol level was found to be 0.075 % during the incident. The final judgement will be held on the 15th and Ir states that she will reflect on her actions."

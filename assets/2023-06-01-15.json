The case was filed in 2016 when the government refused to release a document on the negotiating process for the agreement. The plaintiffs, including comfort women victims, argued that the document was necessary for their right to know. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs argued that the document contained matters related to diplomatic trust between the two countries and could harm the state's interests. The Supreme Court's ruling was criticized by lawyers who argued that it failed to recognize the Japanese government's legal responsibility."

The court ruled against an appeal by the plaintiffs that the documents should be revealed, stating that such disclosure could seriously damage diplomatic relations between the two countries. The agreement contained an apology by the then-Japanese Prime Minister Abe, but words such as 'involvement of the military' and 'sex slavery' were not included in the public version of the document. While it was judged that it would be correct to disclose the issue of the victims, it was considered that releasing the details of the negotiations would not be in the country's significant interests."

The court confirmed that the Information Disclosure Act states that disclosure may harm the state's significant interests in matters of national security, defense, unification, and diplomatic relations. During the Park Geun-hye administration, both countries had declared the comfort women issue in Japan as finalized and irreversible. The lawyer for plaintiffs argued that the people's right to know outweighed the country's interests protected by information, especially as it concerned a matter of deprivation of physical freedom, and debt not protected for comfort women victims. However, the court found that the non-disclosure profits of private diplomatic negotiations outweigh the benefits of disclosure. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said there was a need to maintain a close relationship with Japan towards safeguarding mutual military support agreement (GSOMIA)."
